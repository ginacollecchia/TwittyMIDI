# TwittyMIDI: A Twitter bot for sonifying tweets

Under the tutelage of Hannah Davis on Egghead Tutorials, this is a Twitter bot to generate sound from the tweets it receives, based on the parts of speech of the tweet. Skips over some parts of speech such as articles. Parts of speech detection via the Rita library. Sound and video generation with FFMPEG.
